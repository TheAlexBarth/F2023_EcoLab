# Welcome!

This is the main course site for BIOL 570L. On this site you will have access to the syllabus, course information, code, and other resources. I will frequently update this site as we progress through the course so make sure to check back for content. Assignments will still be submitted through blackboard. Additionally, announcements can be found there as well.

## About this course:

This is an independent, one-credit lab course for upper division students interested in ecology. The primary goal of this course is for students to develop independent ecological investigations which they will complete over the course of the semester. However, there will also be several assigned labs at the beginning of the course to introduce students to basic ecology field techniques.
