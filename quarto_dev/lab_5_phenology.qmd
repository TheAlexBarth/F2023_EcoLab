# This Week

Phenology is the study of cyclical dynamics, typically over annual cycles in natural phenomena. Seasonal variation is a fundamental component of many natural populations and can structure ecological interactions, population growth, and many other phenomena. Read the project plan for a full background. To well characterize phenological phenomena, you need to have long-term datasets. Then you can evaluate how such patterns shift over time.

There majority of the lab will be dicussed on the code page.
