    "text": "About this course:\nThis is an independent, one-credit lab course for upper division students interested in ecology. The primary goal of this course is for students to develop independent ecological investigations which they will complete over the course of the semester. However, there will also be several assigned labs at the beginning of the course to introduce students to basic ecology field techniques."

Students will be trained in basic field techniques and analyses common in ecology. A core portion of this course will be an independent investigation on an ecological topic selected by students.\n\n\nLearning Outcomes:\n\nUnderstand fundamental ecology sampling schemes\nUtilize appropriate statistical tools for analyzing ecological data\nAbility to design quality investigations to test hypotheses\nGain experience with communicating scientific results to peers\n\n\n\nCourse Technology:\nLab activities will included data analysis in the R programming language. While this course will rely heavily on R, prior knowledge is not expected. Students should have access to both R and Rstudio. See here for download information. Data, documents, and code for this course will all be hosted on github. Git and GitHub will not be taught yet it is a great tool for any scientist to be familiar with. Interested people should look more here for a friendly introduction.\nFor independent projects, students are welcome to use whichever software they are most productive in. However R is encouraged.\n\n\nOutdoor activity & safety policy:\nEcology research often requires outdoor data collections in variable conditions and environments. This course is no exception. There will be multiple field trips to nearby areas. Students are expected to consult the pre-lab content and arrive prepared for weather and lab conditions. It is expected that students, to the best of their ability, will engage in data collection during labs. However, please contact be if you feel uncomfortable or unsafe with any lab activity.\n\n\nTransportation:\nFor labs which are not initially meeting at the lab space (Week 2,3,4). You can either meet at the lab space, or at the specified location. Meeting time will vary based on location. Transportation will be available to any students who donâ€™t have access. Carpooling is encouraged.\nAll field trips will end with enough time for students to return to campus by the specified end time of lab.\n\n\nGrades:\nThis is a one credit lab based course. The majority of student grades will be centered on their independent project and lab-based worksheets. There is a total of 1000 points available. Point breakdowns are as follows:\n\nIntroduction Worksheet (10 points) : Prior to the start of lab, students must complete the introduction worksheet.\nLab-based worksheets (50 points each, 200 total): In the first weeks of lab students will complete field labs to test assigned hypotheses. These assignments will be worth 50 points each. Note that there is a tentative 5th worksheet. If we are able to complete the 5th worksheet, then the lowest of the 5 worksheet grades will be dropped. If a lab is cancelled due to weather or other unforeseen circumstance, we will adjust the value of all worksheets to scale to a total of 200 points.\nProject Plan (100 points): Groups/Individual students will propose their independent project following the assigned project plan worksheet. This assignment may be subject to a round of revisions. Early submissions are encouraged.\nData Collection Progress Report (15 points each, 45 total): During the data collection period, students must attend the beginning of lab regardless of their planned collection activities. Students will share with the class their project status and challenges. Active discussion between groups is expected.\nData Analysis Progress Report (15 points each, 45 total): During the data analysis period, students must attend the beginning of lab regardless of their planned activities. Students will share with the class their project status and challenges. Active discussion between groups is expected.\nFinal Presentation (250 Points): Final independent projects will be shared in a standard 15 minute research presentation format. Group members may allocate presentation responsibilities independently, however all group members are expected to present an equal portion. See rubric for more details.\nFinal Paper (300 Points): Final independent projects will be written in a full paper format. See rubric for grading details.\nAuthor contribution statement (50 Points): Evaluation of group members contributions to the final project. Group members will independently report the activity of all group members and assign points. Severe discrepancies will may warrant point deductions on individual project grades.\n\n\n\nLate work & make-up policy:\nAny assignments turned in late will be subject to a 10% grade penalty starting immediately following the due date. For each additional 24-hour period late, a 10% penalty will be added. Some assignments are ineligible for late submission, including the progress reports, final presentation, and author contribution statement.\n\n\nAttendance Policy:\nAttendance is expected for all lab sections. Any expected lab absences should be discussed prior to the start of that lab period.\n\n\nAcademic Integrity:\nAny cases of plagiarism will result in a minimum failure of assignment and may result in further penalties, including automatic failure of the course.\n\n\nGenerative AI & ChatGPT:\nGenerative AI is an extremely powerful tool for anyone who wishes to be a productive scientist. It can be particularly helpful for organizing and writing code and providing the blueprint for text. However, in its current state, ChatGPT and other generative AI applications do not produce work at the level expected of an upper-division undergraduate. If you want to receive a good grade in the course you should not rely exclusively on ChatGPT. If you are not outworking the machine, you are falling behind. Be skeptical of its responses as it cannot be trusted.\n\n\nCo-enrollment with 570 Lecture:\nThis lab course is a fully independent credit. Co-enrollment in the lecture section of 570 is not required nor expected. While content will overlap and it will be beneficial to take both courses, the content will not be synchronous. Note that the major assignment in the lecture section is the Research Proposal. You are welcome to use your independent project as the basis for that assignment. However note that these are separate assignments with different grading structure.\n\n\nClass Schedule:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeek (Dates)\nLocation\nLab\nAssignments Given\nAssignments Due\n\n\n\n\n1 (9/6 & 9/8)\nLab room and near-by campus areas\nIntroduction & Mammal Behavior\nWS1\nProject Plan\nIntro Worksheet\n\n\n2 (9/13 & 9/15)\nHarbison State Forest\nIntermediate Disturbance & Succession\nWS2\nWS1\n\n\n3 (9/20 & 9/22)\nUSC Arboretum\nCommunity Assemblages\nWS3\nWS2\n\n\n4 (9/27 & 9/29)\nVarious Stream Locations\nUrban Aquatic Systems\nWS4\nWS3\n\n\n5 (10/4 & 10/6)\nLab Room\nPhenology Lab\nWS5*\nWS4\nProject Plan\n\n\n6 (10/11 & 10/13)\nLab Room & TBD\nProject Planning and Preliminary data collection\n\nWS5*\nProject Plan Revisions (If applicable)\n\n\n7 (10/18 & 10/20)\nFall Break Modified Class!\nLab Room & TBD\nData Collection\n\nData Collection Progress Report\n\n\n8 (10/25 & 10/27)\nLab Room & TBD\nData Collection\n\nData Collection Progress Report\n\n\n9 (11/1 & 11/3)\nLab Room & TBD\nData Collection\n\nData Collection Progress Report\n\n\n10 (11/8 & 11/10)\nLab Room\nData Analysis\n\nData Analysis Progress Report\n\n\n11 (11/15 & 11/17)\nLab Room\nData Analysis\n\nData Analysis Progress Report\n\n\n12 (11/22 & 11/24)\nThanksgiving Break\nLab Room\nData Analysis\n\nData Analysis Progress Report\n\n\n13 (11/29 & 12/1)\n\nFinal Presentations\n\nFinal Presentation\n\n\n14 (12/6 & 12/8)\n\nCourse Recap\n\nFinal Project Paper\nAuthor Contribution Statement"
